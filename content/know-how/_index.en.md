      <p class='know-how-description'>This spring, with the introduction of telework, while the working hours of workers have been enriched, the employees who are no longer able to see themselves have become worried about the lack of management. Therefore, since they enthusiastically carried out “surveillance activities” such as informal reports and meetings to confirm enrollment, both the manager and those who are being exhausted are exhausted, and an organization that will not achieve even better results will be created. We are in a vicious circle. This site explains what you should do to create a functioning telework system, and know-how that can be realized in a quick and inexpensive way. (To be released in 2021)</p>
