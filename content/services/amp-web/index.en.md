Why is “Google Content Delivery Network Support (AMP)” getting so much attention? AMP is a standard jointly launched by Google and Twitter to make it easier for mobile users to view homepages. Direct translation of AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages) means to speed up mobile pages.

In AMP, the search engine pre-reads the information on the page and directs the link from the search result to display the data without jumping to each page. If your site supports AMP, it will be displayed at high speed to users. The waiting time is short, the user's impression is improved, and the increase in the withdrawal rate can be suppressed.

**Points for speeding up the site**

> When the display speed drops from 1 to 3 seconds, the bounce rate increases by 32%. When the display speed drops from 1 second to 5 seconds, the bounce rate increases by 90%. When the display speed drops from 1 second to 6 seconds, the bounce rate increases by 106%. When the display speed drops from 1 to 10 seconds, the bounce rate increases by 123%.

> After 3 seconds, 57% of users found that they were numb and gave up visiting.
> Exhibit: Mynavi 3 seconds is acceptable-why website performance matters

> With mobile access, the conversion rate maximized when the display speed was 3 seconds, and the conversion rate decreased as the display time increased, and it was halved in 7 seconds.
> Exhibit: Forum for online shop staff-Value of "1 second" related to the performance of EC site. Display speed that meets user expectations
