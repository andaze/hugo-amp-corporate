Small Business Telework 2.0
- How to switch from telework to an era where the company can use telework -

Be prepared for the era of teleworking!

This spring, with the introduction of telework by a pandemic, the working hours of working people have been enriched, while managers have become worried about whether employees who have disappeared can not be seen. Therefore, since they enthusiastically carried out “surveillance activities” such as informal reports and meetings to confirm enrollment, both the manager and those who are being exhausted are exhausted, and an organization that will not achieve even better results will be created. We are in a vicious circle.

The top reason why telework has not taken root in Japan today is that 48.9% of managers in the manager class say they are “not feeling the benefit”. In today's modern world where a lot of work can be done only with a computer, the culture that harmonizes to "come to work and ask the color of your boss" is still a common sense even under these circumstances, and I do not want to break the existing system. Isn't that the real intention of managers?

However, if we cannot respond to this social situation, employees will turn away from us, and companies will be asked to survive. I think that the experience-based know-how is necessary in order to land the “Nanchatte Telework” that I tried for the time being as a “Result-based Telework”.

In this service, we will explain what to do to create a functioning telework system and know-how that can be realized in a quick and inexpensive way. It doesn't matter if your company is big or small, but we'll assume an organization of at least 5 people to see the benefits. We will also add necessary measures based on specific troubles and cases. (Note: Excludes jobs that are physically difficult for telework such as hospitality)

We will realize the Telework 2.0 system with **Operation management and DevOps**. The service is scheduled to start in 2021.
