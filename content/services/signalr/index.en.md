Why is the "two-way communication web service" attracting attention? For information such as stock charts and chats, real-time properties are required as product value. In the old system, the information was updated with a mechanism such as periodic screen updates. It was not a good user experience because the amount of communication for that purpose increased and the screen flickered.

A two-way web service is a mechanism that allows users to browse information stored in the system in real time. Two-way communication allows the server to send messages. Even if the screen is not updated regularly, when the information source becomes new, it will be possible to reflect it on the screen the user is looking at in real time.

**Pros of interactive web services**

- Real-time information is displayed just by opening the browser (no refresh button required)
- Automatically updated screen user experience enhances product value

**Cons**

- Need advanced design compared to unidirectional

We will proceed with the web development of bidirectional communication promptly with the **bidirectional communication framework SignalR**. Please contact our professionals to understand your current situation and plan a plan.

### Case

**Industry**: Major distribution industry

**Issues**: I am operating the e-mail function on the web, but I am operating it while pressing the "Refresh" button of the browser to check for new mail.

**Solution overview**: SignalR pushes that there is new mail from the server side. Use Azure Signal R Service together to maintain the quality of technology and reduce development costs.
